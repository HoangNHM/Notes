I doubt it


[2:56] 
the session is per-user, and a user is for one account.


[2:56] 
also sessions time out


[2:57] 
note the `-H "ABS_SHIB_User_Email: jvilhuber@absolute.com"`


[2:57] 
this tells the session API which user (and therefore which account) the session is for.


[2:57] 
If a session isn't used, it will eventually be deleted by the server, so you have to get a new one.


[2:58] 
I highly recommend the vagrant approach as a long-term solution. I will attempt to formalize that in the next few days.
