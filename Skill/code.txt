Regex Try this to match a line that contains more than just whitespace
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11619265/regex-matching-all-but-not-empty

/.*\S.*/
/ = delimiter
.* = zero or more of anything but newline
\S = anything except a whitespace (newline, tab, space)

so you get
match anything but newline + something not whitespace + anything but newline

if whitespace only line counts as not whitespace, then replace the rule with /.+/, which will match 1 or more of anything.

#List
List<String> supplierNames = Arrays.asList("sup1", "sup2", "sup3");
But note you are not allowed to add more elements to that list, as it's fixed-size.


final List<String> listBaseEntityIds = reportEntityService.getIdsByTypes(types);
String baseEntityIds = String.join(",", listBaseEntityIds);
